            obligations you may have.<br><br>
            You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer 
            code, nor subject the Website's network or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or 
            otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the Website.<br><br>
            You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Website any unlawful, 
            harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,

            You are expressly prohibited from compiling and using other Users' personal information,

            The Operators note that unauthorized use of Users' personal information in connection with

            federal anti-spam statutes. The Operators reserve the right to report the abuse of Users' 
            personal information to the appropriate law enforcement and government authorities, and

            The Operators may, but are not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Website

            including but not limited to user forums and email lists, and the content of any such

            information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provides any information 
            that is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, or we have reasonable

            Operators cannot and do not assume any responsibility or liability for any information you

            website. To learn more about how we protect the privacy of the personal information in your

            including, without limitation, your violation of these Terms and Conditions, the infringement

             <h2 class="title_policy">Termination</h2><br>
            These Terms and Conditions of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no 
            longer agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you must cease use of the 
            Website. If you are dissatisfied with the Website, their content, or any of these terms, 
            conditions, and policies, your sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Website. The 
            Operators reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Website, 
            or parts of the Website, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use (i) 
            is in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests, including 
            intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where the Operators

            <h2 class="title_policy">WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</h2><br>
            The website and associated materials are provided on an "as is" and "as 
            available" basis. To the full extent permissible by applicable law, the 
            operators disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not 
            limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
            particular purpose, or non-infringementof intellectual property. The 
            operators make no representations or warranty that the website will meet 
            your requirements, or that your use of the website will be uninterrupted, 
            timely, secure, or error free; nor do the operators make any representation 
            or warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the 
            website. The operators make no representations or warranties of any kind, 
            express or implied, as to the operation of the website or the information, 
            content, materials, or products included on the website.<br><br>
            in no event shall the operators or any of their agents, vendors or suppliers 
            be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, 
            damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of information) 
            arising out of the use, misuse of or inability to use the website, even if the 
            operators have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This 
            disclaimer constitutes an essential part of this agreement. Because some 
            jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for 
            consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to 
            you.<br><br>
            you understand and agree that any content downloaded or otherwise 
            obtained through the use of the website is at your own discretion and risk 
            and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer 
            system or loss of data or business interruption that results from the 
            download of content. The operators shall not be responsible for any loss 
            or damage caused, or alleged to have been caused, directly or indirectly, by 
            the information or ideas contained, suggested or referenced in or 
            appearing on the website. Your participation in the website is solely at your 
            own risk. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by 
            you from the operators or through the operators, their employees, or third 
            parties shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. You 
            acknowledge, by your use of the the website, that your use of the website is 
            at your sole risk.<br><br>
            liability limitation. Under no circumstances and under no legal or equitable 
            theory, whether in tort, contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, 
            shall the operators or any of their agents, vendors or suppliers be liable 
            to user or to any other person for any indirect, special, incidental or 
            consequential losses or damages of any nature arising out of or in 
            connection with the use of or inability to use the the website or for any 
            breach of security associated with the transmission of sensitive 
            information through the website or for any information obtained through 
            the website, including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of 
            goodwill, loss or corruption of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, 
            or computer failure or malfunction, even if an authorized representative of 
            the operators has been advised of or should have known of the possibility 
            of such damages.<br><br>
            the operators's total cumulative liability for any and all claims in 
            connection with the website will not exceed five u.s. dollars ($5.00). User 
            agrees and acknowledges that the foregoing limitations on liability are an 
            essential basis of the bargain and that the operators would not provide the 
            website absent such limitation.<br><br>
        
            <h2 class="title_policy">General</h2><br>
            The Website is hosted in the United States. The Operators make no claims that the Content 
            on the Website is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to 
            the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the 
            Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for 
            compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of the UN Convention on 
            Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may 
            give notice to the other party only in writing at that party's principal place of business, 
            attention of that party's principal legal officer, or at such other address or by such other 
            method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal 
            delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after 
            the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 
            business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, 
            the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. 
            Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable 
            provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the 
            unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not 
            define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the 
            Operators to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not 
            constitute a waiver and shall not limit the Operators' rights with respect to such breach or 
            any subsequent breaches. Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this 
            Agreement or User's use of the Website must be brought in the courts of Belgium, and you 
            consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action
            you may have with respect to your use of the Website must be commenced within one (1) 
            year after the claim or cause of action arises. These Terms set forth the entire 
            understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or written 
            agreements or understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter. The waiver 
            of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any 
            other or subsequent breach.<br><br>
        
            <h2 class="title_policy">Links to Other Materials</h2><br>
            The Website may contain links to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. 
            These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such 
            sites and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites. The fact 
            that the Operators offer such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, 
            authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products 
            referenced therein, and the Operators reserve the right to note its lack of affiliation, 
            sponsorship, or endorsement on the Website. If you decide to access any of the third party 
            sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites 
            employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that 
            may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held responsible for the 
            accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party 
            sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.<br><br>
            <h2 class="title_policy">Notification Of Possible Copyright Infringement</h2><br>
            In the event you believe that material or content published on the Website may infringe on 
            your copyright or that of another, please contact us!
